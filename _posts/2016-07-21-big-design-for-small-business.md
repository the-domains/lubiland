Big design for small business

So you have a small business. You probably started a few years back, and after the initial buzz it has been ticking over, making you enough money to survive but not enough to feel secure for the future.

In the last few years, with the growth of the online markets and communities, you have seen more and more kids spending their lives staring at their phones day and night, seemingly disconnected from the world that you know. You have a good solid product or service, and people always given you great feedback, so why is the bottom line feels like it could drop out at any minute?

**I hear similar scenarios too often in Guernsey. The life we have here is special and magical, and I believe for some its the resistance to spoil this hidden, in many ways unspoilt by the big dirty world island life that is becoming less and less possible to maintain without it affecting sales and future-proofing of local businesses.**

I believe that the way we (especially the new generation) consume information, products and services has changed dramatically in the last few years, I also believe that in order to stay competitive in the current marketplace business owners have to either embrace the change or get a 9 to 5\. If you have a business and no website and no online marketing strategy, your business will eventually die. I am sorry to be the bringer of bad news, and there could be a couple of exceptions of course, but really, it most likely will.

#### Now, the good news!

It absolutely does not have to cost you thousands of pounds to find your place in the new digital playground.

I combine solid commercial knowledge, understanding of marketplace and current technology trends with great minimalistic design, giving you contemporary, beautifully designed products to enable you to connect with your customers in innovative ways, without compromising on function & aesthetics.

I educate small business owners how to navigate this new terrain in plain language, and absolutely love seeing people embrace the digital and actually have fun doing it.

I do all of this at highly competitive prices, and pride myself on 100% client retention rate. (Well, there was one guy... but there is always one, right?)

## Think of me as a planner with an aesthetic sense, a guide, an educator, an invaluable members of your team.
